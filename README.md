# Pokémon Trubbish Edition

Based on the PokeYellow decompilation project, as well the Pokémon Yellow: Cramorant Edition and Samanthuel/slendidland (she/her) pokemon art project of the original 151 plus 44 favorites of her (i don't know even she made a hack rom, thought..)

This is still in early beta, and only featuring few changes, mostly in few sprites

Please, support the original project, as well Cram-o-dev, Samanthuel and (even you have money) the pokémon company and affiliates
